Simple manual-made list of this config plugins, with a short description:
~ Kickstart.nvim plugins:
    - tpope/vim-sleuth: Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically
    - lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim: Github signs in the gutter
    - folke/which-key.nvim: Shows keybinds (?)
    - nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim: Fuzzy finder thingy, really good
        - nvim-lua/plenary.nvim: Snippets of common lua functions/only works on nvim
        - This is the most complex setup in kickstart, and it works great so I'm not touching it
    - LSP PLUGINS:
        - folke/lazydev.nvim: lua LSP works well for the actual config             
        - neovim/nvim-lspconfig: Main lsp configuration
            - Has a lot of Mason dependencies, but don't want to write them all here
            - j-hui/fidget.nvim: Little notification for the lsp, like loading... notifs and all that jazz
            - saghen/blink.cmp: Autocompletion, but I swear it does not work that well. I think it needs more configuration.
            - Important keymaps
                - grn -> rename
                - gra -> excecute a code action (?)
                - grr -> find references for the word under the cursor
                - gri -> jump to implementation | For interfaces for example
                - grd -> jump to definition
                - grD -> goto declaration (?)
                - g0 -> fuzzy find the symbols on the document
                - gW -> fuzzy find the symbols on the workspace
                - grt -> jumps to the type of the word under the cursor
                    - This is one of those, I whish this was a real IDE thingys
            - Even more Mason stuff
        - stevearc/conform.nvim: Autoformat
        - saghen/blink.cmp: Autocompletion
            - Appears again for better configuration
            - Sets up L3MON4D3/LuaSnip as a snippet engine apperently
            - rafamadriz/frienfly-snippets: Snippets for lua I think
            * REMEMBER SET KANAGAWA TO priority = 1000 *
    - folke/todo-comments.nvim: Highlight todo, notes, warnings, etc. VERY COOL!
    - echasnovski/mini.nvim: Collection of various small independent plugins
        - mini.ai: some keymaps I'm not using
        - min.surround: surround stuff, put a new keymap to autosurround 'za'
        - mini.statusline: customizes the status line, kinda dont want to touch it, dont really read it anyway
    - nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter: highlight, edit, and navigate code
    - neo-tree: (Its actually 'outside' of kickstart, but it comes bundled) vscode like file tree navigation, very cool.
~ Custom plugins
    - Actual plugins:
        - romgrk/barbar.nvim: makes vscode like tabs
    - Themes:
        - kanagawa.nvim: cool theme, didnt noticed it was already installed, made the lua file with custom options.
